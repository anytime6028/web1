    <h2>HTML이란 무엇인가?</h2>
    <p>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application protocol for distributed, 
        collaborative, hypermedia information systems.
        [1] HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web,
         where hypertext documents include hyperlinks to other resources 
         that the user can easily access, for example by a mouse click or by tapping the screen
          in a web browser.

        Development of HTTP was initiated by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in 1989.
         Development of early HTTP Requests for Comments (RFCs) was a coordinated
          effort by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the World Wide Web Consortium
           (W3C), with work later moving to the IETF.
        
        HTTP/1.1 was first documented in RFC 2068 in 1997. 
        That specification was obsoleted by RFC 2616 in 1999,
         which was likewise replaced by the RFC 7230 family of RFCs in 2014.
        
        HTTP/2 is a more efficient expression of HTTP's semantics "on the wire", 
        and was published in 2015; it is now supported by major web servers and browsers over Transport Layer Security (TLS) using an Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) extension[2] where TLS 1.2 or newer is required.[3]</p>
